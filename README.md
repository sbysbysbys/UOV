## Installation
Please follow [installation](INSTALL.md). 

## Data Preparation
Please follow [dataset preperation](DATASETS.md)

## Sueprpixel-superpoint generation

You can choose from the three open-vocabulary segmentation models below:

For CAT-Seg:
Please prepare the checkpoint and other related content according to [CAT-Seg](https://github.com/KU-CVLAB/CAT-Seg/tree/main).
```
# superpixels generation
cd ov_segment/CAT-Seg
python demo/superpixel_generation.py
# superpoints generation
python superpixel2superpoint.py
```

For FC-CLIP:
Please prepare the checkpoint and other related content according to [FC-CLIP](https://github.com/bytedance/fc-clip/tree/main).
```
# superpixels generation
cd ov_segment/fc-clip
python superpixel_generation.py
# superpoints generation
python superpixel2superpoint.py
```

For SAN:
Please prepare the checkpoint and other related content according to [SAN](https://github.com/MendelXu/SAN/tree/main).
```
# superpixels generation
cd ov_segment/SAN
python superpixel_generation.py
# superpoints generation
python superpixel2superpoint.py
```
